# Space-Ship
A game made with pygame and learned from udemy classes of Game development in Python

use mouse to move your ship and dodge the coming asteroids as long as possible
the more you survive the more will be the score which would be displayed at the end of game

You can use the left mouse button to shoot lasers which will destroy the asteroids

I was too lazy to add sounds but will try to add them later.
